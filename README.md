## Project Instructions

### **Project Topic: Markowitz Model with Side Constraints**

In this project, we apply the Mean-Variance Markowitz models for portfolio selection, considering the returns of `n=20` assets observed in the period 01/2004–11/2006 (`MARKOWITZ-DATA20.xlsx`). We study the effect on the empirical construction of the Efficient Frontier given by including additional portfolio constraints in the optimization model.

### **Exercise 1**

#### **1.1**  
Formulate the general Markowitz model which, in a market with `n` risky assets, minimizes the variance of portfolio returns under a constraint which fixes a value `μ` for the portfolio expected return (MwV). Assume that only long positions are possible (no short selling).

#### **1.2**  
Formulate a variant of the model in **1.1** by including a cardinality constraint fixing at `k` the maximum number of selected assets.

### **Exercise 2**

#### **2.1**  
Consider the time series given in the file `MARKOWITZ-DATA20.xlsx`. Compute the expected returns of all assets in the market and the matrix of variances and covariances between the returns of any two assets.

- Formulate and solve the Markowitz model for finding the maximum possible expected return value _for an efficient portfolio_ (`ER_max`).
- Formulate and solve the Markowitz model to find the minimum possible expected return value _for an efficient portfolio_ (`ER_min`).
- Fix 5 different values for the portfolio expected return in the range `(ER_min, ER_max)`, denoting them by `μ₁, μ₂, μ₃, μ₄, μ₅`.

#### **2.2**  
Solve model (MwV) formulated in **1.1** for each possible value `μ₁, μ₂, μ₃, μ₄, μ₅`. Denote by `P_μ₁, P_μ₂, P_μ₃, P_μ₄, P_μ₅` the optimal portfolios so found.

#### **2.3**  
For each possible value `μ₁, μ₂, μ₃, μ₄, μ₅`, solve model (MwV) with the additional constraint formulated in **1.2** by fixing `k=2`. Denote by `PC_μ₁, PC_μ₂, PC_μ₃, PC_μ₄, PC_μ₅` the optimal portfolios so found.

#### **2.4**  
Compute the expected values and the variances of all portfolios `P_μ₁, P_μ₂, P_μ₃, P_μ₄, P_μ₅` and `PC_μ₁, PC_μ₂, PC_μ₃, PC_μ₄, PC_μ₅`.  

- Plot the two groups of portfolios in a single plot, where a portfolio `P` is represented by the point `(σ_P, E(R_P))`.  
- Compare and discuss the differences in the market Efficient Frontier generated by `P_μ₁, P_μ₂, P_μ₃, P_μ₄, P_μ₅` and `PC_μ₁, PC_μ₂, PC_μ₃, PC_μ₄, PC_μ₅`.
